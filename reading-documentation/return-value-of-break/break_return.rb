# In the previous exercise, you learned that the while loop returns nil
# unless break is used. Locate the documentation for break, and 
# determine what value break sets the return value to for the while loop.

# Break either returns the value of the argument it is provided, or
# nil if no argument is provided.

# The documentation doesn't explicitly say break returns nil with no
# argument, it is implied.
